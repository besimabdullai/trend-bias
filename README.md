# Regression by Eye: Estimating Trends in Bivariate Visualizations
This repo contains data and other supplemental material for our [paper](Paper/preprint.pdf?raw=true), presented at [CHI 2017](https://chi2017.acm.org/).

This work examines the ability of people to estimate trends in scatterplots, line graphs, and area charts. In addition to the paper, we've written a [blog post](https://medium.com/@uwdata/regression-by-eye-b7587f4ca1f5) explaining our results.

The [Paper](Paper/) folder contains the paper itself, as well as all figures.

The [Data](Data/) folder contains annotated data tables, stimuli, and the Processing sketch used to generate new experimental stimuli.
